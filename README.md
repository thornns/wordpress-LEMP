# Wordpress for Ubuntu 20.04 using LEMP stack (Linux, Engine X, MySQL, PHP)

### Best for local installation (mysql and wordpress in the same machine)
#### Very little needs to change to make MySQL remote (add hosts to ansible, change the provisioner_playbook to install MySQL in a remote host and change the mysql host in wordpress template)
#### Always remember to check group_vars\all.yaml and personalize your own needs
